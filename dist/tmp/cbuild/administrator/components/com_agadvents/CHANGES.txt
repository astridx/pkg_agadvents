todo
I have three remarks/questions
1) When you are in the editor for an AGadvent, it is not possible to use the 'save a copy' button, because the unique identifier (1-24) remains the same
2) I have had difficulties in saving the hours and minutes of the start and end dates. Mostly I had to do it twice to get it right, since on saving once 00:00:00 switched back to e.g. 21:45:00, the time I created the agadvent.
3) I cannot get centered the main calendar image, the one with the stars. Is there a way to do this without changing the source code?
4) alt im map tag nicht zu description sondern auch zum titel leiten.
